## _Udacity Nanodegree Program_

The project is for the [Data Scientist Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). It consists of picking a dataset, selecting 3 questions and answer them by analysing data. The project is built with Python version 3 using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure
The project is based on the following structure:
- analysis.ipynb. is a python program built using jupyter notebook. It includes the code used to analyse the data.
- survey-results-2019.csv. Includes the data retreived from Stackoverflow survey for 2019.
- survey-results-2020.csv. Includes the data retreived from Stackoverflow survey for 2020.

## Instructions to Run the Project
Step1. Before running the project you must have Jupyter Notebook on your machine. If it is not the case, don't worry just install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
Step2. You need the following packages available as part of Anaconda:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Step3. For the data, you may download them from 2019 and 2020 Stackoverflow Annual Developer [Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). You have to put them in the same folder as the python analysis code.

## Project Motivation
The key motivations behind this project are the following questions:
1) What are the most used and required databases in Tunisia?
2) Is there a correlation between the required and currently used databases in Tunisia?
3) What are the most Databases Tunisian developers are willing to use?
